The following steps will allow you to train a model and test it:

Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/netarch/PCC.git .
git checkout deep-learning

Install dependencies:

// python development libraries
sudo apt-get install libpython3.5-dev

// pip, only if you don't have it.
sudo apt-get install python3-pip

// numpy, scipy, tensorflow, mpi4py and gym
python3 -m pip install numpy --user
python3 -m pip install scipy --user
python3 -m pip install tensorflow --user
python3 -m pip install gym --user

From the base of the repo, build the simulator with:
cd ./sim
python build.py
cd ../

Now, edit the python config file ./experiments/config/pcc_config_njay.py
change: "/home/njay2/PCC/deep-learning/" to your repo path.

Next, to train and test, do:
cd experiments
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
python sim/run_ml_training.py
python sim/run_test.py

Note: run_ml_training.py only runs for a 60 seconds. You can edit the file to make it longer once you know that it
works.
