The following steps will allow you to train a model and test it:

From the base of the repo, build the simulator with:
cd ./sim
python build.py
cd ../

Now, edit the python config file ./experiments/config/pcc_config_njay.py
change: "/home/njay2/PCC/deep-learning/" to your repo path.

Next, to train and test, do:
cd experiments
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
python sim/run_ml_training.py
python sim/run_test.py

Note: run_ml_training.py only runs for a 60 seconds. You can edit the file to make it longer once you know that it
works.
